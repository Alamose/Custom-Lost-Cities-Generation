The config.cfg shows how the assets are now loaded. You can just edit your config to add those lines:

    S:assets <
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/conditions.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/palette.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/palette_desert.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/palette_chisel.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/palette_chisel_desert.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/highwayparts.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/railparts.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/monorailparts.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/buildingparts.json
        /assets/lostcities/citydata/library.json
        $lostcities/highway_fixes.json
        $lostcities/building_modern_0.json
        $lostcities/building_modern_1.json
        $lostcities/building_modern_2.json
        $lostcities/multi_factory_2.json
        $lostcities/palette_neutral_quark.json
        $lostcities/userassets.json
     >

The rest of the files go in the config folder. Nothing else needs to be done with them.
