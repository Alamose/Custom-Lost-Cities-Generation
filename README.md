# Custom-Lost-Cities-Generation
A set of custom Lost Cities building generation using the built-in JSON customization provided by the Lost Cities mod by mcjty.

All you need to do is select which customization you would like to add and place that "userassets.json" in the /.../instance/config/lostcities  folder.
As of right now, only one "userassets.json" file can be used at a time.
