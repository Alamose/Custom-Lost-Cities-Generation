# Custom-Lost-Cities-Generation
A set of custom Lost Cities building generation using the built-in JSON customization provided by the Lost Cities mod by mcjty.

All you need to do is select which customization you would like to add and place that in the /.../instance/config/lostcities  folder.
You must then rename the file to "userassets.json" in order for Lost Cities to recognize it.
If you wish to use more than one file, then you will need to add it to the list in the general.cfg config for lost cities.
